## 💭 Motivation

Many know that there is a huge amount of frameworks, new server applications and tools. But it is very hard to keep track of all the new applications and frameworks who are published almost on a daily-basis. Some are really good, but most do not know them.

tooldb tries to keep track of them. **It is (soon) a massive collection of frameworks and tools for developers.**

## 👥 Based on contributions

Only one person couldn‘t handle the huge collection of tools and keep track of every new one. Everyone can submit their favourite framework or tool with opening an issue on GitHub.

## ✨ Submit tools

To grow the collection of tools, we need *you*! If you have a favourite tool or framework or you found one recently, please submit it on GitHub by creating an issue. The templates will guide you.

## ♻️ Update tool information and images

You can update the information and upload new images of the tools by creating an issue.

## 🗂 Submit categories

**Before submitting new categories, [please check](https://tooldb.dev) if it doesn't already exist.**

Sometimes there are tools or frameworks which there isn't a category for on tooldb. If you have a category for it, please submit it on GitHub by creating an issue.
